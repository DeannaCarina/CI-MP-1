            <p>Perhaps you already have a hotel sorted and you just need to get there? Or perhaps being tied down to one place
                 isn't your scene and you'd rather travel around with a backpack exploring? Then our flight-only deals are the places
                to start!</p>
            <p>With our partners at Virgin Atlantic, Sky Scanner and British Airways, we promise to find you the best fares possible for your 
                journey to the caribbean. From early departure to late arrival, we have all times of all days available to you through our partnerships.
                Want to upgrade your flight? No problem! Need transfers to your accommodation when you arrive? Easy peasy. We have many locations throughout
                the United Kingdom and Ireland as departure points: Heathrow, Luton, Manchester, Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin, Cardiff and Newcastle, however if you would 
                rather leave from another airport or even another country then just let us know and we'd be happy to help! Some of the islands in the Caribbean
                don't have the facility at their airports to accomodate the size of plane needed to cross the Atlantic, in these cases we will organise a 
                connecting flight to the island of your choosing.
            <p>We recommend an early departure time from the UK as most of the Caribbean is between 4 and 6 hours behind our own time zone and the flights take around 
                7-8 hours. This way, if you depart at 8am in the UK, you could get to Barbados by lunch time!

            <p>Want to experience all the highlights of the Caribbean but want to do it under your own terms? Always find that 
                when you book a holiday you're stung with the single supplement charge and end up paying pretty much the same price as two people anyway?
                Then perhaps our specialised solo holidays are the ones for you.</p>
            <p>With our partners at CaribTours, Solos Holidays and Friendship Travel, we can find the perfect solo traveller holiday for you, at a fraction
                of the price that you would pay at the high street travel agents. How can we do this? Well, as we have direct access to all the best spots in the
                Caribbean, and access to the very best travel airlines have to offer, we know which hotels have single rooms, which excursions are better for solo 
                travellers and which flights have odd numbers in seat rows (suprisingly handy when you're a solo traveller!). All of this combined means we can
                get you the very best experience for the very best price, and means that we can            
                <strong>guarantee</strong> to find you your ultimate getaway.</p>
            <p>No longer will you be the one that gets the sad smile from friends and family for being on your own, now you'll be the one that gets to 
                experience all the wonderful things the Caribbean has to offer and you'll get to do whatever you choose! What if someone you were travelling
                with didn't want to go snorkelling but you did? Or they wanted to hiking but you didn't? Well, with our specialised singles holidays there's 
                no need for compromise. Everything we do... it's all for you.

            <p>We also have the option to be 'nearly solo' - this means that (if you'd like) we can group you together on excursions with 3-6 other solo travellers 
                and suggest hotels to you that other known solo travellers are staying at. Because who doesn't like to make new friends?

            <p>Want to exprience what can only be described as 'The most freeing experience'? Find yourself going on holiday but never being comfortable
                because of the heat, and find yourself just wishing you could go topless or even completely nude? Then perhaps having a clothing-optional 
                holiday is what you're after?
            </p>
            <p>With our partners at Chalfont, Aphrodite and Castaways, we can organise this most incredible experience for you. Clothing-optional and 
                naturist holidays are often frowned upon due to the link to holidays based around hedonism and as such most high street travel agents
                do not offer this individual experience, however naturism and hedonism are not the same and it would be wrong to link the two together.</p> 
            <p>There is no shame to the human body, and on a naturist/clothing-optional getaway you'll come to see that other holiday goers just aren't 
                interested in other people's body's, they are there to relax, be at one with nature and to get a nice all-over even tan! Unfortunately 
                due to hurricane Irma in 2017, many of the best clothing-optional resorts in the Caribbean were completely destroyed (such as Club Orient 
                on St Martin), however the team at <em>Travel Carribean</em> have been hard at work finding new places to let you experience this specialist
                type of holiday and as such, we <strong>guarantee</strong> to find you your ultimate getaway.</p>

            <p>These holidays are perfect for everybody of all ages, whether you have tried clothing-optional or not, every body of any shape, size, 
                disability, colour or gender are welcome in our partnered clothing-optional resorts.
