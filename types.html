            <p>With our partners at Virgin Atlantic, Sky Scanner and British Airways, we promise to find you the best fares possible for your 
                journey to the caribbean. From early departure to late arrival, we have all times of all days available to you through our partnerships.
                Want to upgrade your flight? No problem! Need transfers to your accommodation when you arrive? Easy peasy. We have many locations throughout
                the United Kingdom as departure points: Heathrow, Luton, Manchester, Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin, Cardiff and Newcastle, however if you would 
                rather leave from another airport or even another country then just let us know and we'd be happy to help! Some of the islands in the Caribbean
                don't have the facility at their airports to accomodate the size of plane needed to cross the Atlantic, in these cases we will organise a 
                connecting flight to the island of your choosing.
            <p>We recommend an early departure time from the UK as most of the Caribbean is between 4 and 6 hours behind our own time zone and the flights take around 
                7-8 hours. This way, if you depart at 8am in the UK, you could get to Barbados by lunch time!
