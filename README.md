# Introduction
Portfolio Project One: HTML/CSS Essentials - Code Institute - Deadline 1st July 2021

This is my submission for Code Institute's (5P) Portfolio Project One. It is a fictitious company with coresponding website which provides the service of planning customers' holidays in The Caribbean. The website is created with HTML and CSS as well as with the use of many other <a href="#Technologies">technologies</a>. The website covers the most basic function of the company: <em>"The new way to plan your Caribbean getaway"</em>, the steps a customer can take to get started on their holiday ideas, reviews from customers, a gallery page and a page to download the company's brochure which is published every month, as well as two pages to help the customer make the decision of where they would like to go (Islands) and what type of holiday they would like to partake in (Types). There are also contact links at the bottom of all pages with personal links to my own Instagram acount as many static images have come from my own photography portfolio (from index.html, gallery.html and contact.html, as well as the background images of the brochure downloadable).

## Demo
A live demo of the website can be found <a href="https://deannacarina.github.io/travelcaribbean/" target="_blank">**HERE**</a>

## Acknowledgements
<ul>
    <li>To my fiancé - you are my absolute rock and got me through some pretty stressful times! Thankfully as a senior DevOps engineer you were able to stop the mental breakdowns I had when I thought I had to delete my whole project because of a corrupt file... you taught me 'Git Reset'. I love you.</li>
    <li>To my family - thank you for testing the website and giving me lots of tips for making the website have a better user experience, your advice and ideas mean the world and I could never do without you.</li>
    <li>To Nishant Kumar - My mentor. You had to keep me grounded and convince me speeding off at the speed of light isn't always the best thing. I'm still not very good at it... but I am trying to stay grounded and think about things before rushing off to start typing code - perhaps Project Two can be the test?</li>
    <li>To my close work colleages at East Lancs Hospitals Trust - you have supported me through this endevour and also tested out the website, thank you for always wanting the best for me.</li>
    <li>To Katie Raby - You will probably never see this, but you are the reason I'm doing this course. It was your blog post and your journey that has inspired me to become a coder, I'll see you next year at my wedding as you're one of my best friends other halves - but I doubt you'll know how much you've changed my outlook on life. The words 'thank you' will never be enough.</li>
