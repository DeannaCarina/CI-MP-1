# Travel Caribbean

Milestone One Project: HTML/CSS Essentials - Code Institute - Deadline 1st July 2021

This is my submission for Code Institute's Milestone One Project. It is a fictitious company with coresponding website which provides the service of planning customers' holidays in The Caribbean. The website is created with **ONLY** HTML5 and CSS3. The website covers the most basic function of the company: "The new way to plan your Caribbean getaway", the steps a customer can take to get started on their holiday ideas, reviews from customers, a gallery page and a page to sign up to the company's brochure which is published every month, as well as two pages to help the customer make the decision of where they would like to go (Islands) and what type of holiday they would like to partake in (Types). There are also contact links at the bottom of all pages with personal links to my own Instagram acount as many static images have come from my own photography portfolio (from index.html, gallery.html and contact.html, as well as the background images of the brochure downloadable).

# UX
As more people rely on accessing services online the role of UX design has become increasingly important in our digitized world. The five planes provide a conceptual framework for breaking down the task of designing experiences into component elements so that we can understand the problem as a whole [1]. As this framework is structured, regularly used and consistently reliable, I have chosen to use the Five Planes method to design and implement my own website.
## Strategy
### Vision
<em>Travel Caribbean</em> is a specialist travel website focusing on travel to the Caribbean. Planning a holiday to the Caribbean can be daunting and confusing for many people due to the massive amount of choice that the Caribbean provides [2][3]. As a frequent traveller to the Caribbean, I felt there was a gap in the market to provide potential travellers to the Caribbean with a straightforward and easy means of learning about the 
potential locations to travel to, and the different types of holiday they can go on, as well as the different activites and excursions customers can go on once they are in
the Caribbean to experience the best the Caribbean has to offer. Much like an online travel-agent, I hope the website can provide confidence to customers to take the 
leap and book their holiday to the Caribbean as there are so many amazing things to see and do, as well as incredible cultures to experience. From personal experience however, I have found that many online travel agent websites are confusing to navigate and have an overabundance of information, it is my aim to make my own website easily navigatable and provide customers with a structured and logical delivery of information. By doing this, it will encourage customers to stay on the site and want to use the company's services rather than navigate away from the page due to information overload.

### Aims
<ol>
    <li>To earn commision from partner companies that are advertised via the website</li>
    <li>To earn income from customers by charging a fee to plan and organise their Caribbean Holiday (fee included in overall holiday price)</li>
    <li>To build a database of customers that have used the services of the website for future holidays</li>
    <li>To be easily findable via search engines</li>
    <li>To be shareable between current customers and potential customers for potential future revenue</li>
    <li>To help customers decide on where they would like to go on their Caribbean Holiday</li>
    <li>To help customers decide on what type of holiday they would like for their Caribbean getaway</li>
    <li>To help customers decide what they would like to do on their Caribbean Holiday for excursions and activities</li>
    <li>To visually help customers by providing a gallery page of images taken in the Caribbean</li>
    <li>To provide customers with an easy to use and intuitive contact form to be able to request extra information</li>
    <li>To make the site intuative and easily usable to enable customers learn about the Caribbean</li>
    <li>To provide customers with a downloadable brochure to advertise examples of package holidays they can have in the Caribbean</li>
</ol>

### Target Audience
There are a number of target audiences for this website due to the range and number of different locations and holiday types on offer.<br>
The theory of potential target audiences are as follows:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Age 18-30</strong> - This is the group of potential customers that are most likely to want to experience 'rustic' travel [4] </li>
    <li><strong>Age 30-60</strong> - This is the group of potential customers that are more likly to want family holidays</li>
    <li><strong>Age 60+</strong> - This is the group of potential customers that are likely to want holidays away during their retirement, paticularly cruises. This demographic also has a likelihood of having a large proportion of solo travellers [5]</li>
    <li><strong>Naturists</strong> - as clothing optional holidays are very niche, it is important for this group of individuals to have a place to go to cater to their more specialist wants and needs</li>
    <li><strong>Adventurous People</strong> - This is the group of people more likely to use the services of the website to plan and book excursions in the Caribbean</li>
    <li><strong>Newly engaged couples</strong> - This is the group of people more likely to want to organise group holidays for hen and stag parties</li>
    <li><strong>Newly married couples</strong> - This is the group of people more likely to want to use the services of the website to plan a honeymoon</li>
    <li><strong>British People</strong> - Britains account for nearly 40% of foreign tourist arrivals in Barbados [6], I would like to utilise this and target the website towards British travellers as there is a huge market for Caribbean travel from the United Kingdom and Ireland, especially due to the direct flights from international airports such as Manchester and Heathrow.</li>
</ul>

## Scope
Due to the pitfalls of deploying a website based on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) model such as lack of user experience and enjoyment due to a lack of content, I have chosen instead to base the deployment of my product using the MMP (Minimum Marketable Product) as this allows a fully functional application to be used by the customer and can solve user problems with the minimum amount of features while still being completely usable [7] - this however does mean that more time must be spent developing and deploying the application without the guarantee of user satisfaction and possibly result in some 'rough edges' that need to be rectified and de-bugged at a later date. By using this method, any feedback from customers will be based on a fully working web-app and result in fully qualitative data due to the product being in a finished state; rather than feedback based on a web-app that has intentionally been left incomplete resulting in feedback from customers who may believe the site to be inadaquate due to lack of content and intuitiveness.
I have been able to confidently use the MMP model due to my own history of travel to the Caribbean and booking holidays in this area of the world. As a customer myself, I can base the functions needed for the website on my own needs and wants from the past, as well as for the future. By incorporating into the website features that I would want to see on websites that I book my own holidays on, I hope that my wants and needs will translate to the wants and needs of the customers visiting the <em>Travel Caribbean</em> website.
The MMP model will:
<ul>
    <li>Create a clear website with enough content for the customers wants and needs to be fulfilled</li>
    <li>Allow me to work within the scope of my abilitiy while also allowing me to challenge myself in areas that I may need to adapt for the needs of the business and website</li>
    <li>Result in a website with high levels of UX</li>
    <li>Show the consumer the level of knowledge the company has in this area of tourism by having adequate amount of content as well as customer testomonials</li>
    <li>Meet the needs of the business and user</li>
</ul>
While following the MMP model, to meet the user and business goals, my website will include:
<ul>
    <li>A self-designed logo on all pages as assurance to the customer we are a trusted-business with our own identity</li>
    <li>A nav-bar on all pages to be able to navigate to separate pages on the website</li>
    <li>Links to associalted social media on all pages within the footer</li>
    <li>A large amount of visual content as booking holidays is a very visual experience - would you book a holiday without seeing where you're going?</li>
    <li>Information for customers of different locations for their holidays and the different types of holidays they can go on including excursions and experiences</li>
    <li>Customer testimonials from previous clients</li>
    <li>Downloadable brochure from website for customers to see what's on offer</li>
    <li>A large gallery (including videos) to allow customers to visualise their potential holiday destinations</li>
    <li>Contact forms to allow customers to contact the company and book holidays</li>
</ul>
