            Portfolio Project One: HTML/CSS Essentials - Code Institute - Deadline 1st July 2021<br><br>
            This is my submission for Code Institute's (5P) Portfolio Project One. It is a fictitious company with corresponding website which provides the service of planning 
            customers' holidays in The Caribbean. The website is created with HTML and CSS as well as with the use of many other <a href="#technologies-section">technologies</a>. The 
            website covers the most basic function of the company: <em>"The new way to plan your Caribbean getaway"</em>, the steps a customer can take to get started on their 
            holiday ideas, reviews from customers, a gallery page and a page to download the company's brochure which is published every month, as well as two pages to help the 
            customer make the decision of where they would like to go (Islands) and what type of holiday they would like to partake in (Types). There are also contact links at the 
            bottom of all pages with personal links to my own Instagram account as many static images have come from my own photography portfolio (from index.html, gallery.html 
            and contact.html, as well as the background images of the brochure downloadable).<br><br>
            A live demo of the website can be found <a href="https://deannacarina.github.io/travelcaribbean/" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a><br><br>

        <h2>UX</h2>
        <div class="readme-div">
            As more people rely on accessing services online the role of UX design has become increasingly important in our digitized world. The five planes provide a 
            conceptual framework for breaking down the task of designing experiences into component elements so that we can understand the problem as a whole [1]. As this 
            framework is structured, extensively used and consistently reliable, I have chosen to use the Five Planes method to design and implement my own website.<br><br>
            <h3>Strategy</h3><br>
            <h4>Vision</h4>
            <em>Travel Caribbean</em> is a specialist travel website focusing on travel to the Caribbean. Planning a holiday to the Caribbean can be daunting and confusing for 
            many people due to the massive amount of choice that the Caribbean provides [2][3]. As a frequent traveler to the Caribbean, I felt there was a gap in the market 
            to provide potential travelers to the Caribbean with a straightforward and easy means of learning about the potential locations to travel to, and the different 
            types of holiday they can go on, as well as the different activities and excursions customers can go on once they are in the Caribbean to experience the best the 
            Caribbean has to offer. Much like an online travel-agent, I hope the website can provide confidence to customers to take the leap and book their holiday to the 
            Caribbean as there are so many amazing things to see and do, as well as incredible cultures to experience. From personal experience however, I have found that many 
            online travel agent websites are confusing to navigate and have an overabundance of information, it is my aim to make my own website easily navigable and provide 
            customers with a structured and logical delivery of information. By doing this, it will encourage customers to stay on the site and want to use the company's 
            services rather than navigate away from the page due to information overload.<br><br>
            <h4>Aims</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To earn commision from partner companies that are advertised via the website</li>
                <li>To earn income from customers by charging a fee to plan and organise their Caribbean Holiday (fee included in overall holiday price)</li>
                <li>To build a database of customers that have used the services of the website for future holidays</li>
                <li>To be easily find-able via search engines</li>
                <li>To be shareable between current customers and potential customers for potential future revenue</li>
                <li>To help customers decide on where they would like to go on their Caribbean Holiday</li>
                <li>To help customers decide on what type of holiday they would like for their Caribbean getaway</li>
                <li>To help customers decide what they would like to do on their Caribbean Holiday for excursions and activities</li>
                <li>To visually help customers by providing a gallery page of images taken in the Caribbean</li>
                <li>To provide customers with an easy to use and intuitive contact form to be able to request extra information</li>
                <li>To make the site intuative and easily usable to enable customers learn about the Caribbean</li>
                <li>To provide customers with a downloadable brochure to advertise examples of package holidays they can have in the Caribbean</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Target Audience</h4>
            There are a number of target audiences for this website due to the range and number of different locations and holiday types on offer.<br>
            The theory of potential target audiences are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age 18-30</strong> - This is the group of potential customers that are most likely to want to experience 'rustic' travel [4] </li>
                <li><strong>Age 30-60</strong> - This is the group of potential customers that are more likly to want family holidays</li>
                <li><strong>Age 60+</strong> - This is the group of potential customers that are likely to want holidays away during their retirement, paticularly cruises. 
                    This demographic also has a likelihood of having a large proportion of solo travelers [5]</li>
                <li><strong>Naturists</strong> - as clothing optional holidays are very niche, it is important for this group of individuals to have a place to go to cater 
                    to their more specialist wants and needs</li>
                <li><strong>Adventurous People</strong> - This is the group of people more likely to use the services of the website to plan and book excursions in the 
                    Caribbean</li>
                <li><strong>Newly engaged couples</strong> - This is the group of people more likely to want to organise group holidays for hen and stag parties</li>
                <li><strong>Newly married couples</strong> - This is the group of people more likely to want to use the services of the website to plan a honeymoon</li>
                <li><strong>British People</strong> - Britains account for nearly 40% of foreign tourist arrivals in Barbados [6], I would like to utilise this and target 
                    the website towards British travelers as there is a huge market for Caribbean travel from the United Kingdom and Ireland, especially due to the direct 
                    flights from international airports such as Manchester and Heathrow.</li>
            </ul>

            </table>
            <br>
            As we can see from the table above, the viability is higher than the importance, which is good because that means most of the features are able to be implemented, 
            however we must be careful not to implemnt features that would be unneccessary for the website and cause potential confusion for the customer. I must also be 
            careful to stay within the scope of my own coding limitations - implementing features that I have no knowledge or experience of could cause a high liklihood of 
            bugs and errors in the website which would in turn reduce the potential of a positive user experience.<br><br>
            I have plotted the table above into a graph to easily visualise the features that will be implemented into the website and which ones won't be:
            <ul>
                <li>The features in the pink section will be implemented</li>
                <li>The features in the grey section could be implemented at a later date but aren't necessary right now</li>
                <li>The features in the turquoise section will not be implemented as it would be unwise to focus on these features until a later date</li>
            </ul><br>
            <img id="graph" src="../assets/images-readme/user-stories/graph.png" alt="Graph depicting the features that will be included in the website" width="80%"><br>
            <img id="graph" src="../assets/images-readme/user-stories/graph-key.png" alt="Key to show which circles on the graph represent which feature" width="50%"><br><br>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            Due to the pitfalls of developing a website based on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) model such as lack of user experience and enjoyment due to a lack of content, 
            I have chosen instead to base the development of my product using the MMP (Minimum Marketable Product) as this allows a fully functional application to be used by 
            the customer and can solve user problems with the minimum amount of features while still being completely usable [7] - this however does mean that more time must be 
            spent developing and deploying the application without the guarantee of user satisfaction and possibly result in some 'rough edges' that need to be rectified and 
            de-bugged at a later date. By using this method, any feedback from customers will be based on a fully working web-app and result in fully qualitative data due to 
            the product being in a finished state; rather than feedback based on a web-app that has intentionally been left incomplete resulting in feedback from customers who 
            may believe the site to be inadaquate due to lack of content and intuitiveness.<br>
            I have been able to confidently use the MMP model due to my own history of travel to the Caribbean and booking holidays in this area of the world. As a customer 
            myself, I can base the functions needed for the website on my own needs and wants from the past, as well as for the future. By incorporating into the website 
            features that I would want to see on websites that I book my own holidays on, I hope that my wants and needs will translate to the wants and needs of the customers 
            visiting the <em>Travel Caribbean</em> website.
            The MMP model will:
            <ul>
                <li>Create a clear website with enough content for the customers wants and needs to be fulfilled</li>
                <li>Allow me to work within the scope of my abilitiy while also allowing me to challenge myself in areas that I may need to adapt for the needs of the business

            </ul>
            While following the MMP model, to meet the user and business goals, my website will include:
            <ul>
                <li>A self-designed logo on all pages as assurance to the customer we are a trusted-business with our own identity</li>
                <li>A nav-bar on all pages to be able to navigate to separate pages on the website</li>

                <li>A large amount of visual content as booking holidays is a very visual experience - would you book a holiday without seeing where you're going?</li>

            </ul><br><br>
            <h4>Structure</h4>
            I have chosen to carry out a non-linear method of design for this website as it consists of multiple pages which might not necessarily be viewed in a particular 
            order as each page has a different role to play. By having multiple page we can separate large amounts of information into logical sections to make it easier for 
            the user to find what they are looking for. The navigation bar at the top of all of the pages allows the user to easily navigate to the page of the website they are 
            most interested in. There are also certain pages (islands.html and types.html) that have their own internal navigation sections due to these pages being split into 
            logical sections for different islands and different types; these internal page navigation areas mean that the user can be even more specific about what they would 
            like and find it easily.<br><br>
            <strong>On index.html</strong>: I chose for the 'hero video' to be at the top, the next section to be text to capture the user and to further explain the function 
            of the website, the next section to explain the steps the customer should take in choosing their holiday - this section is very straightforward and minimal to allow 
            for intuitive browsing, the next section to be holiday types - just the types, no extra information, then the review section and finally a link to the contact form 
            and brochure. This is the layout that I found to be most logical; as the user moves down the page they are slowly given the information they need in order to 
            organise a holiday to the Caribbean with the company - this avoids information overload and increases the chance of the customer staying on the website. Some of 
            the sections in index.html also have links within them to be able to navigate to other pages on the site to allow for intuitive browsing - whenever this is 
            available to the user, the destination of the link always has a back button just in case the user wants to go back to where they were before e.g. the user clicks 
            on the 'Beach' type button on in the index page which will take them to the Beach section of types.html, however they may want to go back to the index page to the 
            area they were at previously - the back button provided will take them there. I wanted these sections on the home page to be the most important to the user as they 
            have key information within them.<br><br>
            <strong>On islands.html</strong>: I chose to have an iframe at the top from Google Maps, to allow the customer the opportunity to do some exploring of the area 
            themselves should they wish. Under the iframe there is an internal nav area, each link representing a different island or island group. These are mainly organised 
            geographically from the islands at the top of the caribbean moving round in a clockwise fashion ending with the ABC islands. Organising by geographical location 
            made most sense to me, and would make it easier to find particular islands on the iframe map. Within each of the sections I have included a back-to-top button, as 
            the page has a lot of information, I didn't want the user to be constantly scrolling up and down the page to see what other island options there are by viewing the 
            nav-bar.<br><br>
            <strong>On types.html</strong>: I chose to have the same types section from the home page as the internal nav bar, this provides continuity and familiarity for the 
            user. Underneath the nav bar there are nine sections, each representing a type of holiday the customer could have. These don't have a particular order, however I 
            have tried to arrange them as possible popularity - these can easily be moved around and re-ordered as necessary in the future. Within each of the sections I have 
            included a back-to-top button, as the page has a lot of information, I didn't want the user to be constantly scrolling up and down the page to see what other types 
            of holiday there are by viewing the nav-bar.<br><br>
            <strong>On gallery.html</strong>: I have included a large number of images, as from personal experience I like to look at images of places before I choose them as 
            a potential holiday destination. Under the images, I have also incuded videos via YouTube iframe, these videos are made and published via external sources and are 
            to further help the customer decide where they would like to go on holiday and what they would like to do.<br><br>
            <strong>On contact.html</strong>: There are two main sections - one for the downloadable brochure and the other for the contact form. The image of the brochure 
            contains a button to be able to download the brochure pdf file. <br><br>

            <h4>Skeleton</h4> 
            The wireframes for the <em>Travel Caribbean</em> website were made with the <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> Desktop Applictaion, 
            they can be found by viewing the image below and following the links below the image. As there is a number of pages within the website all containing a fairly 
            large amount of content, I chose to create the wireframes based on a desktop layout as this is how I intend for the website to be viewed most frequently, however 
            I have also created a wireframe for the contact page in mobile version, as the layout of this page will change a lot from being in desktop version to mobile 
            version.<br><br>
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-index.png" alt="Wireframe plan of index.html" width="90%"><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Click <a href="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-islands.png" target="_blank">HERE</a> for islands.html Wireframe</li>
                <li>Click <a href="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-types.png" target="_blank">HERE</a> for types.html Wireframe</li>
                <li>Click <a href="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-gallery.png" target="_blank">HERE</a> for gallery.html Wireframe</li>
                <li>Click <a href="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-contact.png" target="_blank">HERE</a> for contact.html Wireframe</li>
                <li>Click <a href="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-thanks.png" target="_blank">HERE</a> for thanks.html Wireframe</li>
                <li>Click <a href="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-404.png" target="_blank">HERE</a> for 404.html Wireframe</li>
                <li>Click <a href="../assets/images-readme/wireframes/wire-bigmap.png" target="_blank">HERE</a> for large map page linked via islands.html Wireframe</li>
            </ul>
            The wireframes were created during the website's initial desgin process, as such there are small changes between the layout of the wireframes and the final 
            layout/design of the finished website. The website as designed via Balsamiq is divided into five main sections (Home, Islands, Types, Gallery and Contact), however 
            there are also eight 'hidden' pages which are navigated to via the Islands page (these are to view the small thumbnail map images in a larger way and all have 
            identical layouts), as well as the page which is navigated to via the submit button (the 'Thanks' page) in the contact form and the 404 error page. The 'Thanks' 
            and 404 pages have almost identical layouts as it didn't make sense to have a completely different layout for these pages due to the low frequency of visits these 
            pages may recieve - these pages are identical to the first section of the index page; I felt this added continuity and design flow to the website, the only 
            differences between them is the video used in the background. Due to the website being heavily visual, I chose to focus mostly on which images I would use as 
            backgrounds in the wireframe process to ensure that the images complimented each other, and the images sizes worked with the design of the web page that it was 
            situated within.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Surface</h4><br>
            <h5>Typography</h5> 
            I used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> to find the typography that I wanted to use for the website. I wanted to use a 
            completely different font for the main title and the headers to the main text body of the website to distinguish between headers and main body, but also to show 
            the importance of different sections and make it obvious for the user/customer when a new section is starting. I chose to use the font 'Satisfy' (seen below) as 
            the cursive writing and free-flow design of it makes it feel more relaxed and whimsical - which is remeniscent of the Caribbean. I initially used an alternative 
            cursive font however this wasn't as easy to read and could have been difficult to understand for those that do not have english as a first language.<br>
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/surface/satisfy.png" alt="Font used for headings" width="70%"><br>
            I did however have some minor problems with this font such as certain letters in lower case looking like other letters (see example below where the word 'or' 
            actually looked like the word 'on'), however this only occured once in the website and was rectified by putting the word in uppercase.<br>
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/surface/font-problem.png" alt="Problem with using the satify font" height="100px"><br>
            The font I used for the main text body of the website was 'Lato' as this font is easy to read which is needed when there is large amounts of information to be 
            read and absorbed by customers, it has a modern feel, and is a popular font for many websites. The back-up font is 'Sans-Serif' just in case the font import link 
            fails.
            <br><br>
            <h5>Colour Scheme</h5>
            As I want the website to be very visual, it made most sense to me to choose a colour scheme based on an image that is regularly used throughout the site. When I 
            think of the Caribbean, I think of the blue and turquoise waters of the sea, so wanted to have the colour scheme pulled from an image that has these colours within 
            it. I chose the image that is repeated at the bottom of the main pages of the turtle, as this has the blues that remind me of the Caribbean. <br>
            <img src="../assets/backgrounds/index-backgrounds/barbados2.jpg" alt="Image used to generate colour pallette" width="70%"><br>
            I then used the website <a href="http://colormind.io/" target="_blank">colormind.io</a> as this allows the creation of a colour pallette from an image rather than 
            a single colour choice. The colour pallette below is the pallette generated from the turtle image. 
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/surface/colour-pallette.png" alt="Generated colour pallette" width="70%"><br>
            I really love the range of blues and will use these throughout my website as background colours and decoration colours. The majority of the pages on the website 
            will have image backgrounds to aid in the visual appeal of the website, however I still want some continuity of colour throughout. As the majority of backgrounds 
            are images, many of the text overlays will have to have a neutral background to have the text be more readable without clashing with the background image, 
            therefore I have chosen the majority of text boxes to have the neutral colour of grey - ranging from darker greys on backgrounds that have a more toned down 
            overall colour (such as the hero video in index.html and the background of the review text boxes):<br>
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/surface/colour-hero-box.png" alt="Image showing background colour of text box over the hero video" height="100px">
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/surface/colour-review-box.png" alt="Image showing background colour of text box in the reviews section" height="100px"><br>
            To lighter and less transparent grey on backgrounds that are more vibrant and could cause problems with reading text (such as those in islands.html and 
            types.html):<br>
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/surface/colour-island-box.png" alt="Image showing background colour of text box in islands.html" height="300px">
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/surface/colour-type-box.png" alt="Image showing background colour of text box in types.html" height="300px">
            <br><br>
            <h5>Icons</h5>
            The icons used in the website were taken from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>, they can be seen throughout the site, are used 
            on all pages for the social media links, and are used as calls to action in the Islands and Types pages to aid in navigation. Font Awesome is also the source of 
            the icon used in the tab of the browser for <em>Travel Caribbean</em>.<br><br>
            The icon used in the header section of the website on all pages was designed in Microsoft Powerpoint. It is made up of a generic png image of some palm trees and 
            incorporated with a border, shadows and light blue eliptical shape (to signify the sea).
            <br><br>
            <h5>Design - Images</h5>
            All stationary images on the Home, Gallery and Contact pages, as well as the background images in the downloadable brochure were taken from my personal photography 
            portfolio, I felt that as I have a personal connection to the majority of the photographs on the website, I would have a better understanding of how the images 
            interact with everything else on the page, I also had the advantage of knowing where each photograph was taken, so the labels on the images in the Gallery are all 
            true and accurate.<br><br>
            The reviewer portraits are actually images of my family (names are falsified for annonymity), so are images either taken by myself or members of my family.<br><br>
            The stationary images on the Islands and Types pages are aquired from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a>, as these sectional areas are 
            quite large and need to have backgrounds of good quality no matter the screen size, I felt it was important to have images of high resolution, many of the images 
            in my portfolio were not the correct orientation or of high enough quality, so pexels was a great resource for aquiring images to fit the needs of the 
            website.<br><br>
            The images in the downloadable brochure of the hotels were taken from the hotel sites themselves:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://sebastiansbvi.com/" target="_blank">Sebastian's on the Beach</a></li>

                <li><a href="https://www.fortyounghotel.com/" target="_blank">Fort Young Hotel, Roseau</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.oasismarigot.com/" target="_blank">Oasis Marigot, St. Lucia Villas</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g147380-d148233-Reviews-Young_Island_Resort-St_Vincent_St_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines.html" target="_blank">Young Island Resort</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Design - Video</h5>
            All background videos on the website were also aquired from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels</a>, I was limited a little in terms of which 
            videos I was able to use due to the limitations on file sizes that can be pushed to and stored on GitHub. It is not best practice to store files of this size on 
            GitHub, however for this particular project (being educational), I chose to use the video compression software 
            <a href="https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor" target="_blank">Free Convert Video Compressor</a> to reduce the file size so all videos had a file size of 
            around 5MB (GitHub limit is 10MB). I wanted to use videos that were of a 'slow-motion' nature to reflect the relaxation and calmness that can come with holidays 
            to the Caribbean. I also wanted to use videos that don't have a lot of variation in colour to ensure continuation of accessibility thoughout the videos duration 
            of text that is overlayed (such as the cover text in the Home page, 404 page and thanks page).<br><br>
            The videos embedded at the bottom of the gallery page were all taken from Youtube, these are generic videos of different places in the Caribbean to inspire the 
            customer and give them ideas about what they might like from their holiday to the Caribbean.

            The main features to be implemented in the website were determined in the Strategy plane of the UX section. Below is the table as a summary of which user 
            stories we are able to implement and which we are not (due to time contraints and developer knowledge limitations).<br><br>

            <br>
            <h3>Implemented Features</h3>
            From the table above, I was able to recognise which features were more likely to have a positive impact on the website and implement those.<br>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Obvious role of the website demonstrated with hero image/video and capture text</em> - I have tried to make the landing page (catering for all 
                    screen sizes) as obvious as possible to identify the role and purpose of the website. The background video itself shows a woman walking through very 
                    shallow water with white sand below while carrying a sun hat; this identifies to the customer that the website is likely to be about somewhere tropical 
                    and warm. The cover text over the video "The new way to plan your Caribbean getway" further identifies to the customer the role of the website - this is 
                    where you can plan your holiday and decide where you'd like to go and what you'd like to do.</li>
                <li><em>Simple design with straightforward navigation to make it easier for the user to understand where to find information</em> - The website has a simple 
                    design throughout, with each page having it's own title and each page having separate sections. The font and colours throughout are all the same adding 
                    continuity and familiarity to the website - improving user experience. These elements were all styled using CSS with psuedo classes for hover actions to 
                    enable the customer to visualise a transitioning style. These first two features meet aim <strong>11</strong> identified in the Strategy section of 
                    UX.</li>
                <li><em>Past customer testimonies to show the company is genuine and trustworthy</em> - this was a very straightforward feature to implement. As my family 
                    and I are frequent travelers to the Caribbean, we were able to write the reviews from our own perspectives based on the types of holiday that we have 
                    had and where we have traveled to. As the customer base increases, and the number of reviews increases, these reviews can be updated or a separate page 
                    implemented on the website specifically for customer testimonies. This feature meets aims <strong>6 - 8</strong> identified in the Strategy section of 
                    UX.</li>
                <li><em>A downloadable brochure for customers to view at their leisure</em> - this is accessible via the contact page. This was a fairly easy feature to 
                    quickly design (using Publisher) and implement. It adds a lot of content for the customer and allows them to see the potential of using the services of 
                    the company. This feature meets aims <strong>2, 6 - 8 and 12</strong> identified in the Strategy section of UX.</li>
                <li><em>An easy to find and intuitive contact form for customers to be able to discuss their holiday wants and needs with the company</em> - Following the 
                    lessons provided by Code Institute in the HTML essentials module, the form was a straightforward feature to implement. It allows the customer to contact 
                    the company and alerts the company to potential customers and potential future income. This feature meets aims <strong>2, 3 and 10</strong> identified 
                    in the Strategy section of UX.</li>
                <li><em>High levels of up-to-date information on the different places customers can go on their holiday and different types of holiday they can have</em> - 
                    It was important for the function of the website to provide customers with information regarding potential holiday locations and holiday types so they are 
                    able to make informed decisions around their holiday. This feature meets aims <strong>6 - 9 and 11</strong> identified in the Strategy section of UX.</li>
                <li><em>Footer on all pages containing social media links for customers to view further information and more customer testimonies</em> - Following the lessons 
                    provided by Code Institute in the Love Running Milestone Project, I was easily able to implement this feature ion all pages of the website. If the company 
                    was 'real' the social media links would navigate the customer to the relevant social media platform company page. This would enable the customer to see 
                    more information about the company, more reviews and contact the company in whichever way they prefer. This feature meets aims <strong>3 - 9 and 11</strong> 
                    identified in the Strategy section of UX.</li>
                <li><em>A highly visually interactive website to show the customer what they are able to experience from a Caribbean holiday</em> - by making the website 
                    interactive, the customer is going to be more inclined to stay on the website and explore the website to learn more about their potential holiday. It also 
                    makes the website seem more professional and seem as if more effort has gone into the design and implementation e.g. in the types section of index.html, 
                    each of the divs linked to the specific type section will go transparent and reveal the image behind it, all of the buttons in the website have the same 
                    psuedo class design to go light blue and have a shadow. These small but effective features will engage the customer and make them more likely to go 
                    through the process of booking a holiday with the company. The large amount of images on the website will also encourage the customer to stay and explore 
                    the site, as customers will always want to visualise where they are going on holiday. This feature meets aims <strong>2 and 6 - 11</strong> identified in 
                    the Strategy section of UX.</li>
                <li><em>A database of external companies affiliated with </em>Travel Caribbean<em> to make it easier for customers to plan excursions and experiences</em> - 
                    The companies affiliated with <em>Travel Caribbean</em> have been incorporated into the 'types' page of the website. This makes it easier for customers 
                    to see the different companies we are partnered with and makes the affliated companies easier to learn about and navigate to as all of the company logos 
                    are linked to the specific company website. This also provides advertising for the company and potential revenue as customers using the <em>Travel 
                        Caribbean</em> website have a high probibility of navigating to the partnership company websites and making a booking. This feature meets 
                        aims <strong>1, 7, 8 and 11</strong> identified in the Strategy section of UX.</li>
                <li><em>A Fully accessible website able to be experienced by customers with visual imparement</em> - This feature is highly important (as outlined in 
                    TESTING.md Accessibility section) it allows all customers to interact and use the website even if they have a visual imparement, meaning that the 
                    company will not lose out on a potential customer base. It also makes the website more inclusive and higher on potential search engine results lists. 
                    This ensures that the company is following Equality and Diversity best practices and will not be liable to litigation from neglegt of this 
                    legislation.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
            Due to time constraints and limitations of coding knowledge I have chosen not to try and implement the following features to the website:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>A database of clients and customers from past holidays and a database of clients and customers of potential interest - this would enable and guarentee 
                    future income for the company from a loyal customer base. Many people like to have a 'yearly getaway' to relax and get away from day-to-day life, this 
                    would be the main source of guarenteed income for the company.</li>
                <li>A booking form for customers to be able to book their holiday with options for hotels, excursions and flights - this would reduce the need for customers 
                    to contact the company directly and free up time for company employees to carry out other tasks such as maintenance of the website and collaborating with 
                    other potential partnership companies.</li>
                <li>A login option for customers to manage and edit their holiday booking - again this would mean the customer would be less likely to need to contact the 
                    company directly and be able to manage their own holiday booking without the help of company employees.</li>
                <li>An interactive 'google-map-style' map for customers to click on which will direct them to the specific location and information - I tired to do this 
                    during development of the website using a static image as a background and divs overlayed with precise postition measurements, however this proved to be 
                    far too buggy for the website especialy as the screen size alters. I instead opted to go for a google maps iFrame for customers to be able to explore the 
                    area as they see fit, with links to specific island groups in a separate nav bar below the iFrame to direct the customer to the specific section in the 
                    web page. Having something more interactive would be possible with the use of JavaScript, however using JavaScript is beyond my current coding knowledge 
                    at this point in the Code Institute course.</li>
                <li>A carousel-type gallery - this would be so customers can focus on one image at a time rather than be overloaded with images. The focus groups I used all 
                    commented on how nice the website looked, however almost all of them just scrolled straight through the gallery page without taking notice of the images 
                    within it. Only 8 out of the 25 individuals that tested the website realised that when you hover or click on an image in the gallery it shows where the 
                    image was taken.</li>
                <li>A hamburger menu for smaller media screen sizes - this would save space at the top of the screen and allow for easier navigation of the website by 
                    removing the need for small text in the nav bar. There could also be the option of having an extending menu for different pages e.g. at the moment 
                    there are 5 pages in the nav bar, there is the potential for an extending list below 'Types' with another 9 navigation links: one for each type of 
                    holiday, and an extending list below 'Islands' with another 8 navigation links: one for each destination.</li>
                <li>A way for customers to select the destination and type of holiday in the islands.html and types.html pages, and for this to update the form in 
                    contact.html with relevant information - I wouldn't know where to begin with this feature on the website, but it would make the website more intuitive 
                    and save the customer time when they come to fill out the contact form.</li>
                <li>A portal for affiliated companies - This would enable the companies to log in to as a way to discuss partnership terms and alter contracts if needed</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <div class="readme-div">
            To make the testing of my website easier and more structured, I have decided to carry out an 'eight-phase' approach: <a href="#Functionality">Functionality</a>, 
            <a href="#Compatibility">Compatibility</a>, <a href="#user-testing-stories">User Testing Stories</a>, <a href="#validation">Code Validation</a>, 
            <a href="#peer-review">Peer Review</a>, <a href="#dev-probs">Development Problems</a>, <a href="#Accessibility">Accessibility</a> and 
            <a href="#perf-test">Performance Testing</a><br><br>
            <h3 id="Functionality">Functionality</h3><br>
            The first phase of my testing regime for the website was to look at the functionality of the website and make sure that it meets the needs of the customer on 
            the most basic levels and also to ensure that all the interactive aspects of the website all worked with no problems.
            <ul>
                <li>The form in contact.html:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Before the form can be subitted, those inputs with required attributes must be completed (First Name, Last Name and Email Address). </li>
                        <li>The Budget and Island group sections are optional as the customer may not know this information yet or may want to discuss these aspects with the 
                            company first. </li>
                        <li>Once required attributed are completed, the submit button will then allow interaction. </li>
                        <li>On selection of the submit button, the form will then direct the customer (via 'action' attribute with a link to thanks.html). </li>
                    </ul>    
                </li> 
                <li>All internal links on the website need to be usable, and open in the same window.
                    <ul>
                        <li>All links in the menu bar at the top of all pages will direct the customer to the relevant page: 'Home' - to index.html, 'Islands' - to

            <h3 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
            The second phase of my testing regime for the website was to ensure that the website is compatible through a range of devices, screen sizes and internet browsers. 
            Throughout the development process, the website was tested on a number of devices: A 17.3 inch windows laptop, a 15.3 inch windows laptop, a 16 inch MacBook Pro, 
            an 8 inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A, a 10.2 inch iPad, A Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and A Huawei P30 Pro. It was also tested in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and 
            Safari as well as Samsung's own internet browser. By also using Chrome Dev Tools, I was able to manually change the screen size to see when elements within the 
            web pages 'break', by using this method, I could pinpoint the exact screen widths and heights to be defined in the CSS media screen queries and alter the stylings 
            to fit accordingly. As I chose not to have a query for phone sizes, another for tablets and another for PCs and instead chose to base the queries on when things 
            start to look 'broken' this did mean a lot of media queries in the stylesheet, however I found it was the best way to ensure responsiveness and to make sure that 
            all elements within the web page were correctly layed out in relation to other elements. The video below shows how I checked the responsiveness of the website at 
            all screensizes.<br><br>

            soon as the customer navigates to the home page, the things they should see are as follows: The 'hero' video, the menuu bar, the logo image and the website 'title': 
            <em>Travel Caribbean</em>. I have used straightforward terminology in the navigation bar so the customer knows where they are navigating to and what they will 
            find once they have navigated there. I feel I have succeeded in this area as I had a number of focus groups divided by age all of which found the site easy to 
            navigate, highly intuitive and knew the exact function of the website at first navigation.</strong><br><br><hr><br>

            <h3 id="validation">Code Validation</h3>
            The fourth phase of my testing regime for the website was to ensure all code written passes through code validation software with no errors or warnings.
                <br><br>
            <h4>HTML Code Validation</h4> 
            Below is a run-through off the code validation process of all pages on the website, all of the pages did come back with errors - some very small, some 
            larger! However all errors and warnings were rectified and all pages now pass through validation with no errors or warnings.
                <br><br>
            <h5>index.html</h5> 
            The below code validation report is from index.html. There were minimal errors found on this page. The main 'errors' were repeated id attributes, this was 
            rectified by replacing the id attributes with class attributes instead.
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/validation/html-validator.png" alt="HTML validation report from W3C" width="100%"><br><br>

           <h5>islands.html</h5> 
            The below code validation report is from islands.html. There were a few validation errors on this page concerning the iframe found at the top of the page 
            containing the interactive caribbean map. One of these was the text within the iframe opening and closing tags - the validator classed this as an error; I 
            found this to be a problem with w3schools rather than the validation service itself by finding a GitHub thread concerning this matter 
            <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/592" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a>. There were also problems with using percentages as 
            height/width and using px as a height/width definition. As I wanted to ensure responsiveness of the iframe, to work around this error, I gave the iframe an 
            id attribute and styled the element within the CSS instead. Once the iframe errors has been rectified, a clean validation report was returned.<br>
            <img src="../assets/images-readme/validation/html-validator2.png" alt="HTML validation report from W3C" width="100%"><br><br>

            <h5>types.html</h5>
            The below code validation report is from types.html. There were minimal errors for this page, the only reported errors were that one or two sections did not 
            contain a heading. To fix this problem, I added heading elements to the sections, but styled the text as transparent and nil display.<br>

            <h5>gallery.html</h5>
            The below code validation report is from gallery.html. There were a few validation errors on this page concerning the iframes found in the video section of 
            the page. One of these was the text within the iframe opening and closing tags - the validator classed this as an error; I found this to be a problem with 
            w3schools rather than the validation service itself by finding a GitHub thread concerning this matter 
            <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/592" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a>. There were also problems with using percentages as 
            height/width and using px as a height/width definition. As I wanted to ensure responsiveness of the iframe, to work around this error, I gave the iframe an 
            id attribute and styled the element within the CSS instead. Most of the errors concerning the iframes in the gallery page were brought about by the pre-built 
            code from Youtube's embedding option. Once the iframe errors has been rectified, a clean validation report was returned. The error report from before code 
            cleanup can be found <a href="../assets/images-readme/validation/errors-gallery.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.<br>

            <h5>contact.html</h5>
            The below code validation report is from contact.html - the page website visitors are directed to when the form on contact.html is submitted. It needed a 
            slight alteration to change the back 'button' from a button element to a div element as the code validator showed an error when the button was wrapped in 
            an anchor element.<br>

            <h5>404.html</h5>
            The below code validation report is from 404.html - the page website visitors are directed to when an invalid web address is used. It needed a slight alteration 
            to change the back 'button' from a button element to a div element as the code validator showed an error when the button was wrapped in an anchor element.<br>

            <h5>Large map page linked via islands.html Wireframe</h5>
            The below code validation report is from one of the pages used to magnify the map thumbnails from islands.html. All of the validation reports were identical 
            for these pages as they are almost identical (the only difference is the map image and the heading text). All of these needed a slight alteration to change the 
            back 'button' from a button element to a div element as the code validator showed an error when the button was wrapped in an anchor element.<br>

            <h4>CSS Code Validation</h4>
            The main edits that I needed to make to the CSS file during code validation were as a result of changing ID's to Classes in the html files and having 
            stylings for the iframes in the CSS rather than in-element stylings. The only 'errors' that came back were for some stylings (around 3 or 4) that I had 
            accidentally given a value of '0', these were removed and the code re-run through the validator, it then passed with no errors or warnings.

            <h3 id="peer-review">Peer Review</h3>
            As a students of <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/" target="_blank">Code Instutute</a> we have 
            <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/" target="_blank">Slack</a> as a resource to help and compliment our learning. We are able to post our web pages and 
            GitHub repositories for other students to review. I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/OliverCadman" target="_blank">Oliver Cadman</a> and 
            <a href="https://github.com/MattBCoding" target="_blank">Matt Boden</a> for taking the time to look at my website and for pointing out some of my mistakes. 
            All problems identified by my peers were rectified straight away. Extra pairs of eyes really do make a huge difference in the development of websites.<br>
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="dev-probs">Issues found during development</h3>
            Due to the limitations of only working with HTML and CSS, I found it quite difficult to make some of my ideas a reality - such as a custom interactive map in 
            islands.html. It was my intention to have a static map (image) of the Caribbean but then have different islands 'light up' when the customer hovers over them 
            and have a label appear to state which island it is. I found some pre-made JavaScript code to be able to do this, however decided it would be more challenging 
            (and rewarding) to meet the aims of the website while staying within the confines of HTML and CSS.<br><br>
            <h3 id="Accessibility">Accessibility</h3> 
            <em>"By making your website accessible, you are ensuring that all of your potential users, including people with disabilities, have a decent user experience and 
                are able to easily access your information.  By implementing accessibility best practices, you are also improving the usability of the site for all 
                users." [8]</em>
                <br>
                Due to the importance and necessity of accessibility on websites, I have chosen two independant accessibility evaluation tools: 
                <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Wave Accessibility</a> and <a href="https://color.a11y.com/" target="_blank">A11y Color</a> 
                Contrast Checker. I chose two in order to cross-check accessibility and ensure the website passes tests from more than one source. For all pages in 
                the website the accessibility evaluation and improvement process was as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>Run the web page though the <a href="https://color.a11y.com/" target="_blank">A11y Color</a> Contrast Checker</li>
                <li>Run the web page through the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Wave Accessibility</a></li>
                <li>Rectify any errors that resulted from the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Wave Accessibility</a> check regarding code errors and 
                    contrast errors</li>
                <li>Re-run the web page through the <a href="https://color.a11y.com/" target="_blank">A11y Color</a> Contrast Checker</li>
                <li>Compare results from the two <a href="https://color.a11y.com/" target="_blank">A11y Color</a> Contrast Checker analysis to ensure all previous errors 
                    are rectified.</li>
            </ol>
            This seemed to be the most efficient way of ensuring all accessibility criteria were evaluated and addressed. 
            As <a href="https://color.a11y.com/" target="_blank">A11y Color</a> Contrast Checker specifically looks at colour contrast, I felt it was important to rely 
            on this more as a way to look at contrasting colours. <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">Wave Accessibility</a> is a very good all-round tool 
            and very good at pointing out where the problems are, so I used this tool to pin-point the problems to then fix them, but then confirmed the colour contrast 
            errors in the page were fully rectified by re-running the web page through <a href="https://color.a11y.com/" target="_blank">A11y Color</a>.<br>

            <h3>Project Creation</h3>
            This project was created on GitHub and Edited in GitPod by carrying out the following:
            <ol>
                <li>A new repository was created using 'Code-Instutute-Org/gitpod-full-template'</li>
                <li>A meaningful name was given to my new repository and I selected 'Create Repository'</li>
                <li>I then opened the repository on GitHub and clicked the 'Gitpod' button to build the GitPod workspace which would allow me to build and edit the code used to make the <em>Travel Caribbean</em> Website</li>
                <li>Version control was used throughout the project using the following commands in the terminal using Bash
                    <ul>
                        <li>git add . <strong>OR</strong> git add "file name" - to stage the changes and get them ready for being committed to the local repo.</li> 
                        <li>git commit -m "Description of the update" - to save the change and commit the change to the local repo</li>
                        <li>git push - to push all committed shanges to the GitHub repo associated with the GitPod workspace</li>
                        <li>commit --amend - I am prone to typing errors, this command came in very handy for changing the wording or spelling of the most recent commit</li>
                        <li>git reset "commit hash" - I only used this a couple of times when I decided to take certain sections in a different directions e.g. resize all images to a certain size, commit and push, but then decide I want them to be bigger/smaller.</li>
                        <li>git push -f - This was used to force changes through to the GitHub repo if either "commit --amend" or "git reset" were used</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Deployment</h3>
            This project was deployed via GitHub pages by carrying out the following:
            <ol>
                <li>Log in to GitHub</li>
                <li>In the repository section, select the repo to be deployed</li>
                <li>In the menu at the top of the page select 'settings'</li>
                <li>Select 'pages' in the left hand side menu</li>
                <li>In the source section, the 'Master' branch is selected and the save button selected</li>
                <li>The web page is then assigned it's URL which will appear in the source section*</li>
            </ol>
            *It can take some time for the site to be deployed when the 'save' button is pressed and a URL created.
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Local Deployment</h3>
            There are many ways to deploy the project locally on your own device. The ways I will explain here are: Forking, Cloning, GitHub Desktop and Zip Exctraction, the steps in these processes are outlines below:
            <br><br>
            <h4>Forking the GitHub repo</h4>
            If you want to make changes to the repo without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This will make sure that the original repo remains unchanged.

            <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>To my fiancé - you are my absolute rock and got me through some pretty stressful times! Thankfully as a senior DevOps engineer you were able to stop the mental breakdowns I had when I thought I had to delete my whole project because of a corrupt file... you taught me 'Git Reset'. I love you.</li>
                <li>To my family - thank you for testing the website and giving me lots of tips for making the website have a better user experience, your advice and ideas mean the world and I could never do without you.</li>
                <li>To Nishant Kumar - My mentor. You had to keep me grounded and convince me speeding off at the speed of light isn't always the best thing. I'm still not very good at it... but I am trying to stay grounded and think about things before rushing off to start typing code - perhaps Project Two can be the test?</li>
                <li>To my close work colleages at East Lancs Hospitals Trust - you have supported me through this endevour and also tested out the website, thank you for always wanting the best for me.</li>
                <li>To Katie Raby - You will probably never see this, but you are the reason I'm doing this course. It was your blog post and your journey that has inspired me to become a coder, I'll see you next year at my wedding as you're one of my best friends other halves - but I doubt you'll know how much you've changed my outlook on life. The words 'thank you' will never be enough.</li>
